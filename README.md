As the provided examples show, the estimator is superior to the ordinary population mean
for symmetric heavily tailed distributions, like the T or the Laplace distributions.
In 1000 trials, the optimal estimator is better roughly 662 trial runs
and the population mean is better in just 338 trials.

For standard normal distributions, a few executions of the last example show that the estimator
is somewhat equal to the population mean (within the supplied confidence interval delta and
apart from numerical floating point imprecisions). In 1000 trial runs, the population mean is
sometimes slightly better in 516 runs and in 484 cases the optimal estimator is better.


Unfortunately, it appears that for asymmetric distributions, like the inverse Gamma distribution,
or the exponential distribution, the ordinary population mean is better, even though the difference
is not as much as in the case of the T or Laplace distributions. For 1000 trial runs with the inverse Gamma,
the population mean is roughly 530 trials better than the optimal estimator mean, which is better in 470 cases.

It appears that this has something to do with the asymmetry. The exponential distribution is even more
asymmetric than the inverse Gamma distribution. In 1000 trial runs, the population mean is better in
576 cases and than the optimal estimator is better in 424 cases.

More trials seem to establish this picture. The estimator works as good as the population mean for symmetric
Gaussian distributions. It works much better than the population mean for symmetric heavy tailed distributions
but it appears to have problems with asymmetric distributions. One should note, however, that these problems
are not as large as the improvements that one gets in the heavy tailed case.

Not only the number of "better" trials are important but also the error margin, which for heavy tailed distributions
is considerably lower with the optimal estimator.



The implementation consists of a function

mean

that computes the optimal mean estimator for numpy arrays.

it expects a numpy array a, a confidence parameter delta and its other
arguments match the behavior of the numpy.mean function whose documentation is
given here:
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html



The computed mean estimator is by default a numpy f64 value if the array is of
integer type. Otherwise, the result is of the same type as the array, which is
also similar as the numpy mean function.

The estimator is computed to fulfill the equation

P(|mu-mean|<epsilon)>=1-delta

by default, delta=0.05.



The module also has a function

mean_flattened

This function works in the same way as mean, but it flattens the arrays that it recieves
and also has no optional out parameter. Instead of a matrix, it returns single int, float or complex values.

        a: A numpy array whose mean is computed. can by of integer, floating or
        complex type and have arbitrary axes.

        delta: a float value. The computed estimator fulfills
                P(|mu-mean|<epsilon)>=1-delta. The default is 0.001. Note that
                the size of the sample must be larger than ln(1/delta).

        axis:  a tuple defining the axes over which the mean is to be computed,
               default isnone

        dtype:  numpy type of the computed result. Per default, if a is an
                integer array, a numpy.f64 is returned, otherwise, unless
                specified explicitly, the default return is of the same type
                as the array a.
                Note that if an int type is specified, float64 values are used
                during the computation in order to increase precision.

        out:    a numpy array that stores the means.
                If the result is a matrix out must have the same shape
                as the computed result. If the result is a single mean value, the
                output is stored in out[0].

        keepdims: boolean, the default is false. If  set to True, the reduced axes
                are left in the result as dimensions with size one and the
                result broadcasts against the input array.
        where: a boolean numpy array. Elements set to false are discarded from the
                computation

    Returns:
        The computed mean estimator is by default a numpy f64 value if the array is of
        integer type. Otherwise, the result is of the same type as the array, which is
        also similar as the numpy mean function.

# Examples:
## Example 1

    import numpy as

    import optimal_mean_estimator.optimalmean as ope

    x = np.arange(1*2*3*4)

    x=np.reshape(x,(1,2,3,4))

    axes=(2,3,0)


    ordinary_mean=np.mean(x,axes)

    print(ordinary_mean)

    optimal_mean=ope.mean(x,0.001,axis=axes)

    print(optimal_mean)

## Example 2

    import numpy as

    import optimal_mean_estimator.optimalmean as ope

    x = np.arange(1*2*3*4)

    x=np.reshape(x,(1,2,3,4))

    axes=(2,3,0)


    mask = np.zeros(1*2*3*4)

    mask[:3] = 1

    np.random.shuffle(mask)

    mask = np.reshape(x,(1,2,3,4))

    mask = mask.astype(bool)

    ordinary_mean=np.mean(x,axes,where=mask,keepdims=True)

    print(ordinary_mean)

    optimal_mean=ope.mean(x,0.001,axis=axes,keepdims=True,where=mask)

    print(optimal_mean)

## Example 3

    import numpy as

    import optimal_mean_estimator.optimalmean as ope

    x = np.arange(1*2*3*4)

    x=np.reshape(x,(1,2,3,4))

    axes=(2,1)

    ordinary_mean=np.mean(x,axes,dtype=np.int32)

    print(ordinary_mean)

    optimal_mean=ope.mean(x,0.001,axis=axes,dtype=np.int32)

    print(optimal_mean)


## Example 4

This example shows that the estimator works for heavy tailed distribution like the T or the Laplace distributions.
If executed several times, it also shows that, appart from small numerical floating point problems, for symmetric distributions
that are not heavily tailed, the estimator yields similarly good results as the ordinary sample mean.

However, for heavily asymmetric distributions, like the inverse Gamma, or worse the exponential distributions, the ordinary sample mean seems to
perform much better.
